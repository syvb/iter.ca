Note that the admin UI may miss a post if the state cache is cleared, or if the server isn't running when the post is made. However, voting the moderator's post should always work. \r\n\r\nOn the admin page, it requires the posting key of @steem-1up, to broadcast the ``custom_json`` op.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I added a script to pay out to delegators, based on [postpromoter's script](https://github.com/MattyIce/postpromoter/blob/master/delegators.js), as `delegators.js`. Run it for details of how to use it. Note that delegation payouts are rounded to have 5 decimal places. This shouldn't make much of a difference to payouts. It will send 200000 UP total tokens to delegators, based on how much they have delegated. (if you've delegated 50SP out of 100SP total, you will get 100k UP tokens).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Admin page\r\n![Admin page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10530973/46571571-41e12280-c945-11e8-9b40-0418d66a0370.png)\r\n\r\n### User wallet page\r\n![Wallet page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10530973/46571581-5a513d00-c945-11e8-9aa8-1a8d994d933a.png)\r\n\r\n### Top UP holders (lists all of them)\r\n![Top holders](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10530973/46571583-65a46880-c945-11e8-95d4-13c0c142b955.png)","Date":{"Unix":1540879520},"Uri":"https://github.com/therealFlauwy/1UP/pull/51","Title":"Add UP token support","Verbose":1,"GhIssueNumber":51,"GhRepo":"therealFlauwy/1UP"},

The reason that such a blanket implementation doesn't exist is because it's not technically possible. Just adding a `impl<T: Ord> PartialOrd for T` block to `core` would result in an error:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nerror[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `std::cmp::PartialOrd<&_>` for type `&_`\r\n --> src/lib.rs:1:1\r\n  |\r\n1 | impl<T: Ord> PartialOrd for T {\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: conflicting implementation in crate `core`:\r\n          - impl<A, B> PartialOrd<&B> for &A\r\n            where A: PartialOrd<B>, A: ?Sized, B: ?Sized;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is already a blanket implementation in `core` that implements `PartialOrd` for all references to `PartialOrd` types. By implementing `PartialOrd` for *all* types that implement `Ord`, it would be possible to have `PartialOrd` implemented for the same type twice. It would then be unclear which implementation should be used. Consider this code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]\r\nstruct X;\r\nimpl PartialOrd for X {\r\n    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {\r\n        panic!(\"1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nimpl Ord for &X {\r\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {\r\n        panic!(\"2\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the traits that get implemented on `X`\r\n\r\n- `X: PartialOrd` (directly implemented), panics with `1`\r\n- `&X: PartialOrd` (blanket implementation for references), panics with `1`\r\n- `&X: Ord` (directly implemented), panics with `2`\r\n\r\nBut if we were to implement `PartialOrd` automatically, then there would be an additional implementation of `PartialOrd` on `&X` that panics with `2`. It is ambiguous how it should be resolved.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this is to use specialization, which is an unstable feature in Rust, that didn't even exist when Rust 1.0 was released. As such, not implementing `PartialOrd` was the only option. Specialization allows the same item to have multiple conflicting trait implementations in a way that is unambiguous, but it is currently unstable, unsound, and nightly only.

The memory model for JavaScript atomics [\"takes significant inspiration from LLVM\"](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_sharedmem/blob/5acab4636ead3cc9fe13b0d97a40c7dadab2fed9/LLVM_LIKE.md), so it doesn't seem like a stretch to guess that the `Atomics` functions were just copied from what LLVM had.\r\n\r\n[LLVM supports 6 intrinsic operations](https://llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html#libcalls-atomic): `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `xor`, and `nand`. It supports those ones because [GCC has intrinsic operations with the same names](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM/LIbrary#line-238) (except for the type). Atomic `and`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, and `xor` operations [were added to GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2011-August/320670.html) ([`nand` was added later](https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2011-September/323038.html)) as a part of adding support for `std::atomic` in C++11.\r\n\r\nC++11 has 5 bitwise atomic operations in `std::atomic`: add, sub, and, or, xor. (but not nand, which gets an intrinsic in GCC but no actual support in `std::atomic`). Why? Because that is what was suggested in the [2007 paper](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2324.html) originally proposing atomics in C++, which defines the operations \"fetch-and-{add,sub,and,or,xor}\". They don't provide a reason for only having those 5 operations, but my guess is that they wanted to minimise the amount of implementation work for compiler implementors, since you can get a NOT operation by XORing against all ones. Or maybe they just didn't think about it.","Verbose":1},

It turns out all Rust programs have an implict dependency on either `core` or `std` though (although you can avoid this with the unstable `#![no_core]`, but good luck actually getting anything to compile that way), so you probably want to get the bitcode for that too.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do that is to compile the standard library from source to bitcode. [`cargo` has experimental support for building the standard libraries from source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std), so just append `-Z build-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (and update the target if needed) to your `cargo` build command. When using `--target`, which is required by `-Z build-std`, the build files are put in a target-specific directory, `target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/` in this case. The targetless directory contains build-dependencies for the standard libraries: we don't want that!\r\n\r\nWe don't want to link *all* of the standard libraries. We really only need `std` and its dependencies: `proc_macro` isn't needed here since we are compiling to a binary, not a proc-macro. We also need to link with either `proc_abort` or `panic_unwind`, matching it up with the unwind codegen setting we chose. The default is unwinding, so let's delete the other one, `proc_abort`. Let's send those libraries to the chopping block: `rm target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/{panic_abort,proc_macro}-*.bc`.\r\n\r\nLet's try linking for real this time:\r\n```lang-bash\r\nrm -r target/\r\nRUSTFLAGS=\"--emit=llvm-bc\" cargo build --release -Z build-std --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrm target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/{panic_abort,proc_macro}-*.bc\r\nllvm-link target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/deps/*.bc > withalldeps.bc\r\n```\r\n\r\nYay, it worked! Well, except for the calls to undefined functions in there that still managed to slip through. `__rust_alloc`, `__rust_dealloc`, `__rust_realloc`, and `__rust_alloc_zeroed` are magic functions that are defined if you use Rust's LLVM fork. The standard library also depends on `libpthread` and [`dlsym`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym) which are language-asnostic libraries/functions that are usually implemented in C. You can use `clang` and a `libc` implementation that supports being compiled with Clang (GNU libc doesn't, I think musl might work here?) to get that if needed. Also if you are compiling to an executable it has trouble finding `main` from `_start`.","Verbose":1},

Also ensure you are using the right linker. But if you really want to remove that argument, it is possible using some unstable features.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a general way to remove individual linker arguments. The `eh_frame_header` target attribute indicates if the linker should insert a EH (exception handling) frame header. Unstable rustc does have support for changing individual target options, but it is a bit complicated and can only handle `#![no_std]` binaries on some platforms. You might want to consider just calling the linker manually.\r\n\r\nFirst, [dump the JSON target metadata](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/custom.html) (using a nightly compiler) for the target you are compiling *to*, replacing `[target]` with a target triple like `thumbv7neon-unknown-linux-musleabihf`:\r\n```bash\r\n$ rustc -Z unstable-options --print target-spec-json --target [target] > target.json\r\n```\r\n`target.json` now has target-specific compilation information. On some targets (such as WASM), EH frame headers are disabled by default. If you see a line like this in `target.json`, you are already done (and shouldn't be getting that error):\r\n```json\r\n  \"eh-frame-header\": false,\r\n```\r\nIf you don't see that line, then add it to `target.json` right after opening brace, like\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"eh-frame-header\": false,\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\nYou can now specify the path to `target.json` wherever a target triple would normally be. However, you now need to recompile the standard libraries (such as `core` and `std`) with the new target information. Otherwise, the compiler will tell you that ``the `target-17676080659170949227` target may not be installed``. On unstable Cargo, you can use `-Z build-std`\r\n to do that:\r\n```bash\r\n$ cargo +nightly run -Z build-std=core --target target.json\r\n```\r\nIt will take a bit longer than normal, since it needs to recompile the `core` standard library. Not all platforms support compiling the fuller `std` library this way, but you can change the `build-std=core` to just `build-std` if you want to try to build the whole `std` standard library as well.","Verbose":1},

Rust doesn't have a complete specification, but the `repr` attribute [is mentioned in the Rust reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/type-layout.html#representations), so it is absolutely a part of the language. Implementation-wise, attributes are parsed the same way all other Rust code is, and are stored in the same AST. Rust has no \"attribute pass\": attributes are an actual part of the language. If someone else were to implement a Rust compiler, they would need to implement `#[repr(C)]`. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, `#[repr(C)]` *can't* be implemented without some compiler magic. In the absence of a `#[repr(...)]`, Rust compilers are free to arrange the fields of a `struct`/`enum` however they want to (and they do take advantage of this for optimization purposes!).\r\n\r\nRust does have a good reason for using it's own memory layout.

Thinking quickly, you pull your notepad out, and form the following table:</p>\r\n>\r\n> |% of bag filled|Text on the stone|\r\n> |-|-|\r\n> |12%|ONTMCR|\r\n> |18%|MLRKAP|\r\n> |27%|EDJCSH|\r\n> |32%|LKQJZO|\r\n> |54%|CBHAQF|\r\n> |74%|UTZSIX|\r\n> |86%|QPVOET|\r\n\r\n### The proper way to solve this\r\n\r\nAll of the texts on the stones are the word `POUNDS` with different amount of letter rotations:\r\n\r\n% of bag filled | Text on the stone|Offset|Unscrambled|\r\n----------------|------------------|------|-----------|\r\n12%             | ONTMCR           |2     |POUNDS\r\n18%             | MLRKAP           |3     |POUNDS\r\n27%             | EDJCSH           |11    |POUNDS\r\n32%             | LKQJZO           |4     |POUNDS\r\n54%             | CBHAQF           |13    |POUNDS\r\n74%             | UTZSIX           |21    |POUNDS\r\n86%             | QPVOET           |25    |POUNDS\r\n\r\nThe offset value is treated as the weight of the stone in pounds for this puzzle.\r\n\r\nHere's what we need to figure out: we need to fill up our knapsack with stones to make it as heavy as possible, keeping in mind that we can't overfill the bag. This is a form of [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\r\n\r\nThe optimal solution is to put the 2 pound and 25 pound stones in our bag. Combined they take up 98% of our bag and weigh 27 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle text says that we need to enter a code into \"an **alphanumeric** keypad\", so we know the next URL to go to is all digits. Since the sticky note says `/##¬£` (¬£ is the currency symbol for British pounds), we know to get to `/27` next.\r\n\r\n### The cheaty way to solve this\r\n\r\nJust try all numbers from 0-100. I wrote a script to try all possible numbers, but it wouldn't be to hard to do this manually.\r\n\r\n## /27\r\n\r\nThe final stage is a quiz with 10 questions, randomly selected from a pool.

Let's decode the kidnapper's notes. This cipher is not a simple Caesar cipher, but it does seem to be a sort of substitution code.\r\n\r\nThe cipher used here was familiar to me because, *\\*sigh\\**, the cipher used here is very similar to the way certain models of Cisco Wi-Fi routers attempt to obfuscate their configuration. They used to just have it in plaintext, but then someone found some security issues with the way config files are handled, so Cisco just obfuscated the contents of the config file a little bit.\r\n\r\nAnyways, what's happening here is that each letter in the messages has been replaced with another letter uniformly. For example, all `w`s have been replaced with `x`s. We can easily find most of the mappings with a known-plaintext attack. Remember that haiku from a section ago? Some of the text in the the second note matches up to that.

When getting lists of posts through the Stack Exchange API, which has various methods to obtain lists of posts that contain both questions and answers, and sorting by the `creation` date, the ordering is inconsistent. Sometimes the question comes before the answer, sometimes the answer comes before the question. The ordering appears to depend on some internal database state.\r\n\r\nFor instance, [this listing of my posts][2] sometimes returns [the question][3] first, and sometimes returns [the answer first][4]. If you make a bunch of queries in a short period of time, it seems that due to caching the ordering will stay the same, but my daily cron job that hits that endpoint notices the changes.\r\n\r\nThis also happens in the few places of the website where questions and answers are displayed together.

Normal: question is oldest, answer is newer][5]][5]\r\n\r\nInstead of this current behaviour, the question should always be before the answer.

But downloading the `.blt` file from [the election page on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/election/13) tells a different story: that `.blt` has 28328 votes in it: it seems 3 votes are missing. The file has 28338 lines, with 1 ballot per line, but 10 of those lines are metadata and not votes, leaving a mere 28328 votes in it. [Here are the scripts I used to get those numbers](https://github.com/Smittyvb/so21ele).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, here are the votes in the OpaVote file missing from the SO file (this is a bit complicated to get since the SO file has 1 vote per line but the OpaVote one lumps identical votes together):\r\n```\r\n1 1 0          # Zoe\r\n1 6 2 4 5 1 0  # Dharman, Ryan M, Daniel Widdis, Stephen Rauch, Zoe\r\n1 1 2 6 4 5 0  # Zoe, Ryan M, Dharman, Daniel Widdis, Stephen Rauch\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happened to these three votes in the SO file? Perhaps they deleted their account and that deleted their vote too? Perhaps there was a race condition where 3 people voted in between the generation of the two files?

For example, if a treaty required that Canada make certain things illegal, then the legislature would have to pass legislation making that thing illegal to make Canada compliant with its treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nApproving a new NATO member wouldn't affect domestic law at all, as there is no bill the legislature would need to pass to implement it. It would effect military operations, but the executive branch already has the power to decide military strategy (the King is the commander-in-chief of the military, he delegated those powers to the governor general, and the governor general by convention only acts on the advice of the Cabinet). \r\n\r\nNote that unlike many other countries (such as the US), the Canadian constitution is mostly silent on the topic of international treaties, only mentioning treaties agreed to by the UK on behalf of Canada (at the time the constitution was written, Canada couldn't agree to treaties itself), so there are no constitutional requirements for the legislative branch to approve any treaties.\r\n\r\nAlso note that treaty implementing legislation is almost always passed, since the executive branch needs to maintain the support of a majority of the legislature. If the legislature doesn't pass implementing legislation, then the legislature would also be very likely to pass a no-confidence motion, which would usually trigger a new election.","Verbose":1},

Court fees that are a \"obstacle that prevents some people from benefitting from the law as much as other people\" [*have* been found unconstitutional](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc59/2014scc59.html) by the Supreme Court of Canada in [Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia v. British Columbia (Attorney General)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc59/2014scc59.html). Instead of the equal protection clause, [section 96 of the *Constitution Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-3.html#h-25) is the basis on which these court fees are disallowed:\r\n\r\n> The Governor General shall appoint the Judges of the Superior, District, and County Courts in each Province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThis clause (along with 92(14), which grants provincial governments jurisdiction over \"the Administration of Justice in the Province\") has been interpreted as prohibiting provincial or federal governments from enacting laws that that remove jurisdiction from the superiour courts. It \"confers a special and inalienable status on what have come to be called the ‚Äòsection 96 courts‚Äô\".\r\n\r\nParagraph 22 answers your question:\r\n> It was argued that all hearing fees are unconstitutional; as courts are a ‚Äúfirst charge on government‚Äù, charging fees for time in court is as offensive to democracy as charging fees for voting.  However, this argument is flawed because it focuses on the type of the fee, rather than the real problem ‚Äï using fees to deny certain people access to the courts.  Moreover, the argument raises policy issues relating to how governments should generate revenue and allocate their funds.  Hearing fees paid by litigants who can afford them may be a justifiable way of making resources available for the justice system and increasing access to justice overall.\r\n\r\nAnd (para. 35-36):\r\n\r\n> Here, the legislation at issue bars access to the superior courts in yet another way ‚Äï by imposing hearing fees that prevent some individuals from having their private and public law disputes resolved by the courts of superior jurisdiction ‚Äï the hallmark of what superior courts exist to do. As in MacMillan Bloedel, a segment of society is effectively denied the ability to bring their matter before the superior court.\r\n>\r\n> It follows that the province‚Äôs power to impose hearing fees cannot deny people the right to have their disputes resolved in the superior courts.  To do so would be to impermissibly impinge on s. 96 of the *Constitution Act, 1867*.  Rather, the province‚Äôs powers under s. 92(14) must be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the right of individuals to bring their cases to the superior courts and have them resolved there.\r\n\r\nThe reasons go into more detail as to what specifically made hearing fees in question deny access to the superior courts.\r\n\r\nThe reasons don't mention the equal protection clause, but it doesn't seem like the equal protection clause would also make some court fees unconstitutional. By your interpretation of the equal protection clause, *all* administrative fees would be unconstitutional. The Canadian constitution also grants fairly broad powers to the federal and provincial governments to raise taxes. The federal government can take part in \"the raising of Money by any Mode or System of Taxation\", and provinces can \"Direct Taxation within the Province in order to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial Purposes\". Court fees are a form of raising money for the government, so it doesn't seem that the equal protection clause would be applicable here. (But it's kinda moot since the use of court fees to make the courts unavailable for people with less money is already unconstitutional).\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that if you can't afford the relevant court fees, you can get them waived.","Verbose":1},
